# Variables: `let`, `const` and `var`

- Variables are containers for storing data. You can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. 
<h4 class=' text-[#5D8392]'>Variables Naming convention </h4>

1. The first character must not be a digit. 

2. When the name contains multiple words, use <span text-red>Camel Case. </span> 

3. Reserved words ( like JavaScript keywords ) cannot be used as names. 

4. Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, and c, unless you know what you‚Äôre doing.

5.  Make names maximally descriptive and concise.
6. Separate multiple words with underscore ( _ )

```js{monaco-run} {autorun: false}
let message;
message = 'Hello';
console.log(message)
```

---
hideInToc: true
---

## Variable{.text-common} `const`

- Variables declared with <span class='text-red'> const </span> do not change and cannot be reassigned.

```js {monaco-run}
const tutor = "Mr Setemi"
console.log(tutor)
// the data Mr setemi is now assigned to variable tutor
tutor = "Mr Ojo" //can not be reassigned
// Therefore values that can change later on should not be declare with const
```

### Variable{.text-common} `let` and `var`

- Variables declared with  <span class="text-red">'let'</span> and <span class="text-red">'var'</span> can change and be reassigned.

```js {monaco-run}
let tech_School = "Altschool";
tech_School = "Altschool Africa"; // Tech school is now reassigned to Altschool Africa
console.log(tech_School)
var hobby = 'reading'; hobby = 'coding';
console.log(hobby)
```

- Examples

```js
// The first character must not be a digit. 
let 1first;    ‚ùå
let firstName; ‚úÖ
Const test123; ‚úÖ
```

```js
// When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is used
let myVeryLongName; ‚úÖ
let MYVERYLONGNAME; üôÖüèΩüôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
let myverylongname; ‚ùå
```

```js
// Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names 
let if; ‚ùå
let boolean; ‚ùå
let else; ‚ùå
```

```js
// Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, and c, unless you know what you‚Äôre doing.
//  Make names maximally descriptive and concise.
let currentUser = 'John Doe' ; 
let data = 'John Doe'
let x = 'John Doe'
// Which is descriptive? currentUser
```

# [Data types]{.text-common}
- A value in javascript is always of a certain type.

- Numbers can be written with or without decimals, that is represent both integer and floating point numbers.

```js
let weight = 7.5
let length = 20
```

- A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes, can be double quote, single quotes or backticks.

```js
let country = 'Nigeria'
let subject = "Software Engineering"
const greetings = `Hello Altschooler's` //backticks allow single and double quotes inside a string
//Double and Single quotes are simple quote. There is no difference between the two.
//Avoid doing this!
let snacks = "meatpie' // It is very wrong, if you want to use double quote then stick to it.
```

- Boolean type has only two values: True and False

```js
let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let isLagosBig = false 
```

---
hideInToc: true
---

- Undefined indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.

```js
let age; // the variable age was declared but not assigned a value
let age = undefined //it also possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable
```

- BigInt are used to store big integer values that too big to be represented by normal Javascript Number

```js
const bigInt = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
```

- Object are used to store collections of data.

```js
// Object
const car = { type: 'Fiat', model: '500', color: 'white' }
```

- It used to create a unique identifier for objects

```js
const mySymbol = Symbol('unique identifier');
const person = { name: 'Alice', [mySymbol]: 'secret information' };
```

- Null: It a special value which represents "nothing", "empty" or "value unknown"

```js
let age = null;
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: More on Variable Declaration
---

Example: To know the type of a value in JS use <span class="text-red"> typeof </span>

```js {monaco-run}
let name = 'John Dev'; let age = 21; let isMarried = false; let height = null; let weight = undefined;
const mySymbol = Symbol('unique identifier');
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  [mySymbol]: 'secret information'
};
console.log(typeof name, typeof age, typeof isMarried, typeof height, typeof weight, typeof person, typeof mySymbol)
```

- Note: the typeof null returns object

```js{monaco-run} {autorun: false}
let name = 'John';
let age = 25; let isMarried = false; let height = null;
let weight = undefined;

console.log(name, age, isMarried, height, weight);
```

# Interaction: `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`

- The alert() method: displays an alert box with a mesage and an OK button.
- The prompt() method: It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel. It accepts two arguments.
- The confirm() method: The function shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel

#### Alert{.text-common}

- The alert() method displays an alert box with a mesage and an OK button

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
alert('Hello V4 Frontend Developer, Enjoying Javascript so far?')
```

#### Prompt{.text-common}

- It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.
- It accepts two arguments. <br> The syntax:


---
hideInToc: true
---

```js
result = prompt(text to show visitor, [default]) //default is an optional parameter, the initial value for the input field
```

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
interview_Question = prompt('What is the full meaning of CSS?', '')
console.log(interview_Question === 'Cascading Style Sheet' || interview_Question === 'cascading style sheet')
```

#### Confirm{.text-common}

- The function shows a modal window with a question and two buttons: OK and Cancel
- The syntax:

```js
result = confirm(question);
```

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let altschoolStatus = confirm("Are you a v4 student ?");
console.log(altschoolStatus);
```

# Type conversion

- It simply means the process of converting one data type to another.

1. String Coversion - Can be done using the `String` or `.toString`.
2. Numeric conversion - Can be done using the `Number`, `parseInt`, `parseFloat` or `+` unary plus sign.
3. Boolean coversion - `Boolean` constructor or `!!`

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false, lines:true}
console.log(typeof String(2)); console.log(typeof Number(2).toString());
let value = '10';
console.log(typeof Number('12')); console.log(typeof +value); console.log(typeof parseInt(value)); console.log(typeof parseFloat('10.34'))
console.log(Boolean(value)); console.log(!!value);
```

There is a concept that says everything in JavaScript is truthy while `false`, `0`, `''`, `NaN`, `null`, `undefined` are falsy.

# Operators: `Math`, `Comparison`, `Logical`,` Bitwise`, `Null Coalescing`, `Optional Chaining`

### The following operators are supported in Js 

<div flex="~ row" gap-4xl>

<div>

- Addition  ( + )
- Subtraction ( - )
- Multiplication  ( * )

</div>

<div ml-36>

- Division ( / )
- Remainder ( % )
- Exponentiation ( ** )

</div>

</div>

```js {monaco-run}
let sumOfTwoNumbers = 20 + 309; let differenceOfTheIntegers = 90 - 45;
let mul = 2 * 97; let div = 24 / 2; let mod =  59 % 7; let expo = 2 ** 4;
console.log({sumOfTwoNumbers, differenceOfTheIntegers, mul, div, mod, expo})
```

# Comparison

- In JavaScript, we use special symbols called <span class="text-red">operators</span> to make these comparison. All comparison operators return a boolean value.
- Here are the main comparison operators:
1. Equals to ( == ):  This checks if two values are the same, it does not care about the type.<br>
<span text-red>Note:</span> ( = ), it an assignment operator and it is different from the double ( == ).

```js {monaco-run}
console.log(5 == '5')
```
2. Strictly equal to ( === ): This checks if two values are the same AND of the same type.

```js {monaco-run}
console.log( 5 === "5")
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: More on Operators
---

3. Not equal to ( != ): This checks if two values are different.

```js {monaco-run}
console.log( 5 != '6')
```
4. Greater than ( > ): Checks if the left value is bigger than the right.

```js {monaco-run}
console.log(10 > 5)
```

5. Less than ( < ): Checks if the left value is smaller is smaller than the right.

```js {monaco-run}
console.log( 5 < 10)
```

6. Greater than or equal to ( >= ): Checks if the left value is bigger than or the same as the right.

```js  {monaco-run}
console.log(10 >= 10)
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: More Examples on Operators
---

7. Less than or equal to ( <= ): Checks if the left is smaller than or the same as the right. 

```js {monaco-run}
console.log(5 <= 5 )
```

- Example: Age-based content access

```js {monaco-run}
let userAge = 15; let contentRating = 13;
if (userAge >= contentRating) {
    console.log('Access granted to the content');
} else {
    console.log("sorry, you're too young for this content")
}
```

---
hideInToc: true
---

# Logical operators

1. || (OR) : it evaluates its operands from left to right and returns the first operand that is truthy. If all operands are falsy, it returns the last operand. `result = a || b`

```js{monaco-run} {autorun: false}
alert(true || false); alert('Boy' || 4)
```

2. && (AND): returns true if both operands are truthy. If either operand is falsy, the entire expression evaluate to false. `result = a && b;`

```js{monaco-run} {autorun: false}
alert(true && true); alert(false && true)
```
3. ! (NOT): it inverts the truth value of an expression, meaning returns false if expression is truthy, and true if expression is falsy. `result = !expression;`

```js{monaco-run} {autorun: false}
alert(!true); alert(!0)
```

---
hideInToc: true
---

# Nullish Coalescing ??

- It provide a concise way to handle <span class='text-red'>null</span> or <span class='text-red'>undefined values</span>. It returns the left-hand side operand if it's not null or undefined; otherwise, it returns the right-hand side operand

```js
// expression1 ?? expression2
```

- Expression1 is the value to be checked.
- Expression2 is the default value to be returned if expression1 is null or undefined.

```js {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
let name;
let greeting = name ?? `Hello, Stranger!`;
console.log(greeting)
```

# [Conditional Branching: if, '?', switch]{.text-common}

- Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different conditions, Welcome to conditional branching.
- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>The If statement </span>:  it evaluate a condition and if the result is true, execute a block of code.
- Syntax:
```js
if (condition) {
    //block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```
<br>
```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let day = 'Monday' 
if (day == 'Monday'){
    console.log('Today is Monday')
}
```
<p><span text-red>Note:</span> If the condition  is false, the code will not run</p>

hideInToc: true
name: Conditional Expressions
---

```js
let size = 25;
if (size == 20){
    alert('Your size is 20')
    alert('Thank you')
}
```

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'> if-else </span> : the else clause may contain an optional block if code that evaluate when the condition is false.

```js
if (condition) {
    //block of code to be executed if code is true
} else {
    //block of code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let age = 20; let canVote;
if (age < 18) {
    canVote = `User can't vote`;
} else {
    canVote = `user can vote`
}
console.log(canVote)
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: Nested If Statements
---

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>The else if statement </span>: use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false. Used to test several variants of a condition.

```js 
if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
}else if (condition2) {
    //block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    //block of code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false
} 
```

- Example:

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let age = 20; let canVote;
if (age < 18) {
    canVote = `User can't vote`;
} else if ( age == 18 ) {
    canVote = `user Can vote`;
} else {
    canVote = `user is a senior citizen`
}
console.log(canVote)
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: Switch Statements
---

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>Switch </span>: A switch statement can replace multiple if checks. it gives a cleaner way of comparing a value with multiple variant
- Syntax
```js
switch (expression) {
    case x:
    // block code
    break;
    case y:
    // block code

hideInToc: true
name: Ternary Operator
---

<span class='text-[#5D8392]'> Conditional operator (?)</span>: also called ternary operator can be used to assign values based on a condition. It is called ternary because it takes three operands.

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
```
- Example
```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let age = 20;
let canVote = age >=18 ? 'Yes' : 'No'
console.log(canVote)

# Loops: `while`, `for`, `for..in`, `for..of`

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>The 'while' loop</span> : loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```js
while(condition){
    //code block to be executed
} 
```

<div flex="~ row" gap-10>

<div flex="1">

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let i = 0;

    i++;
} while ( i < 3 )
```

</div>
</div>

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>For loop</span>: The syntax is quite simple. it has 3 major part.

```js
for (initialization part; condition check; increment part){
    // loop body
}
```

- Initialization part: is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block
- Condition Check: defines the condition for executing the code block.
- Increment: is executed (every time )  after the code block has been executed

# Functions: Declaration, Arrow functions, Function Expressions

- Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- To declare a function, here is the syntax:

```js
function name(parameter1, parameter2, ...parameterN) {
    //code to be executed
}
```

<h4> Important things to note: </h4>
1. The <span class='text-red'> function </span> keyword goes first.
2. The name of the function follows
3. A list of parameter (if any) is enclosed in parentheses.
4. The function body, containing the code to be executed, is enclosed in curly braces {}.
5. To execute the code, function must be called by its <b>name</b> followed by parentheses.

<h5> Example: A function to greet new users </h5>

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
function greetUsers (name) {
    return 'Hello, ' + name + ' welcome to JavaScript course 101';
}
let userName = 'Busola'
let greetingMessage = greetUsers(userName);
console.log(greetingMessage)
```

<h5> Example: A function to add two number </h5>

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
function addNumber (num1, num2){ return num1 + num2 }
console.log(addNumber(7, 20))
```
---
hideInToc: true
---

- <h3 class='text-[#5D8392]'> Outer Variable</h3>

A variable declared outside a function, becomes <span text-red>global variable</span> also known as outer variable. A function can access an outer variable, it can modify it too.

```js {monaco-run}
let university = 'AltSchool Africa';
// code here CAN use university
function school() {
    let message = `You are a student of ${university}`;
    alert(message)
    //code here CAN also use university
}
```

- Note: It's important to understand that outer variables can be modified from within functions, potentially affecting their values in the outer scope. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

---
hideInToc: true
---

- <h3 class='text-[#5D8392]'>Local Variable</h3>

A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside the function. Local variables are only recognized inside their function.

```js {monaco-run}
// code here can NOT use university
function university () {
    let university = 'AltSchool Africa'
    //code here CAN use university
}
// code here can NOT use university
```
---
hideInToc: true
name: Function Expression
---

- <span class='text-[#5D8392]'>Function Expression</span> are indeed another way to create functions in Javascript. They allow you to define a function as part of an expression, typically by assigning it to a variable.This approach offers flexibility in how and when you define functions.

```js
let functionName = function (parameters){
    //function body
}
```
- Example: 

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
const greetUsers = function (name) {
  return `Hello, ${name} welcome to JavaScript course 101`;
};

let userName = 'Busola';
console.log( greetUsers(userName));
```

---
hideInToc: true
name: Arrow Functions
---

- Arrow functions is a very simple and concise syntax for creating functions.

```js {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
const greetUsers = (name) => `Hello, ${name} welcome to JavaScript course 101`;

let userName = 'Busola';
console.log(greetUsers(userName))
```

```js  {monaco-run} {autorun:false}
let sumOfTwoNumbers = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sumOfTwoNumbers(8 , 49))
