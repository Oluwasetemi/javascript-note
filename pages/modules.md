# Module basics

<div />

[What is a module?]{.text-gradient.font-hand.text-10.pr-3.pl-0}

A module is just a file. Modules can load each other and use special directives `export` and `import` to share functionality. Modularity is a key aspect of large-scale software development. It is the process of breaking a program into separate, interchangeable components that can be used in different parts of the program.

Export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module then import allows the usage in other modules. Modules have come to JavaScript relatively recently. Before, there were no modules in JavaScript, and every script included in the HTML had access to all other scripts. Which could be a problem for global variables and functions and the order is important. So, modules are a way to solve these problems.

For instance, if we have a file `sayHi.js` exporting a function:

<div flex="~ row" gap-10>

```js
// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`)
}
```

```js
// üìÅ sayHi.js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`)
}
export { sayHi }
```

```js
// üìÅ main.js - named import
// because of a valid named export
import { sayHi } from './sayHi.js'
```

</div>

# What is Importing?

- Importing is the method by which you make exported code available in another JavaScript file. This is essential for assembling various components and libraries to build complex applications.

- Import \* as `<var name>`: This syntax allows you to import all exported code from a module and assign it to a single object. This is useful when you want to import multiple modules into a single file.

- Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces import {...}, like this:

<div flex="~ row" gap-10>

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import { sayHi, sayBye } from './say.js'

sayHi('John') // Hello, John!
sayBye('John') // Bye, John!
```

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import { sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye } from './say.js'

hi('John') // Hello, John!
bye('John') // Bye, John!
```

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js'

say.sayHi('John')
say.sayBye('John')
```

</div>

- But if there‚Äôs a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using `import * as <var name>`, for instance:

- At first sight, ‚Äúimport everything‚Äù seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?

- Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: sayHi() instead of say.sayHi().
- Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier.

<div flex="~ row" gap-10>

```js
// üìÅ say.js
...
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};

//Now hi and bye are official names to be used in imports:
```

```js
// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js'

say.hi('John') // Hello, John!
say.bye('John') // Bye, John!
```

</div>

- Export and import directives have several syntax variants(named, renamed, default, dynamic).

- You can label any declaration as exported by placing export before it, be it a variable, function or a class and then import it in another module. Named exports allow more than one export while default exports allow only one export per module. Renamed during export and import is also possible.

For instance, here all exports are valid:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// export an array
export let months = [ 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec', ]
// export a constant
export const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015
// export a class
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }
}
```

Encapsulation of modules to avoid namespace pollution and to avoid global variables. Reusability of code and maintainability of code helps in code organization and structure. Modules help with dependency management and code splitting. JavaScript supports various module formats, such as CommonJS (used in Node.js) (require, AMD and ) and ES Modules ESM (introduced in ES6).

Below are the different ways to import code from a module focusing on ESM:

```js
// named import
import { months } from './months.js'
// named import with alias
import { months as MyMonths } from './months.js'
// default import
import User from './user.js' // User is default export and can be renamed
// renamed import
import * as MyUser from './user.js'
```

# Dynamic Imports

- Dynamic imports revolutionize how modules are handled, offering a more flexible approach compared to static imports. Static imports require all modules to be loaded at the beginning of a script, increasing initial load times and potentially impacting performance. In contrast, dynamic imports load modules on demand, which can significantly reduce initial load times and enhance user experience.

<div flex="~ row" gap-10>

```js
// Static import (traditional method)
import { module } from './path/to/module.js'
```

```js
// Dynamic import
const module = await import('./path/to/module.js')
```

</div>

- Explanation: The above example contrasts the traditional static import with a dynamic import. Notice that dynamic imports use a promise-based syntax, which means they can be used within asynchronous functions or handled with .then() and .catch() for greater control over timing and error handling.

- Dynamic imports are particularly beneficial in scenarios where parts of your application are conditionally used or not immediately necessary. Below are common use cases and implementations.
